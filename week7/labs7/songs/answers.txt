Average energy: 0.65906
Average valence: 0.484443
Average danceability: 0.71646

Therefore, this user's audio aura would be energetic and danceable, but with a low valence.

This approach to calculate the user's audio aura may not be very effective because the algorithm is only considering
the top 100 songs, and to some users that may not be very significative. Another situation would be that these are the
top 100 songs the user has listened in the year, but in the last months they have started to listen to completely different
songs, and since the algorithm is taking into account the whole year, the user's most recent preferences are ignored.
