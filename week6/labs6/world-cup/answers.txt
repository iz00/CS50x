Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations, not all teams had probabilities considered, and the numbers were rounded,
as simulations increased, the numbers got more precise and more teams were considered.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations, but considering the leap that existed between 1000 and 10000,
a 1000 simulations would be good enough
