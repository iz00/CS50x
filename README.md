## About

- [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) is a Harvard University's introductory course to Computer Science and Programming. It includes fundamental concepts such as abstraction, algorithms and data structures, as well as practice with languages like C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

- The course's content is divided in 10 weeks, each composed of a [Lecture](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/syllabus/#lectures), a [Problem Set](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/syllabus/#problem-sets), a [Lab](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/syllabus/#labs) (*2024 onwards Labs have become Problem Sets*) and optionally, [Additional Practices](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/practice/).

- This repository contains my solutions for the Additional Practices, Labs and Problem Sets, organized by week. The [Final Project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/project/) is in a [separate repository](https://github.com/iz00/birthday-hub).

- Since I began CS50x in 2023, but kept working on it in 2024, my work from the previous year was carried over. However, some [assignments changed](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/new/), and that is the reason some links take to the 2023 version.

## Academic Honesty

As per the course's [Policy](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/honesty/):
> The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Unless otherwise specified, collaboration on assessments (e.g., assignments, labs, problem sets, projects, quizzes, or tests) is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your work to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policyâ€™s other constraints.
